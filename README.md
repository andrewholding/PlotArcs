# Star Trek Plot Arcs as a Graph

I found my daughter was watching Star Trek The Next Generation on Netflix this morning [https://twitter.com/AndrewHolding/status/1249657290015363072?s=20]. 

It reminded me that one of the odd things about The Next Generation, compared to later series, was that while there were recurring themes. These were rarely plot arcs. 

As a result, I made this an overly detailed graph of how The Next Generation stories map. It's completely subjective, especially Picard's arc. The choices reflect the episodes I enjoyed and remembered. 

I think my next steps would be:

Add in Seven of Nine's key episodes.
Highlights the best 25 episodes to cover best plot arcs.
Consider how to include DS9 and Voyager character acts.
