# Star Trek Plot Arcs as a Graph

I found my daughter was watching Star Trek The Next Generation on Netflix this morning [https://twitter.com/AndrewHolding/status/1249657290015363072?s=20]. 

It reminded me that one of the odd things about The Next Generation, compared to later series, was that while there were recurring themes. These were rarely plot arcs. 

As a result, I made this an overly detailed graph of how The Next Generation stories map. It's completely subjective, especially Picard's stories. The choices reflect the episodes I enjoyed and remembered.

I have now written some R code to generate these from a csv file and made one for The Original Series. I don't know it as well, and it lacks the ensemble cast of TNG but it's a bit of fun still.
